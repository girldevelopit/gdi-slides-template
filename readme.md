## Course description

This class is an introduction to Swift and iOS App Development for beginners to programming or for those who have no iOS or Swift development experience. At the end of class, we will have built an iPhone app that uses the phone's camera to take a picture and then share it on social media. We'll learn the Swift programming language and key iOS concepts and design patterns as we go.

### Prerequisites:

There are no educational prerequisites for this class.

### Tech requirements:

You will need a recent Mac laptop with Xcode ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12 ) installed. It is a very large application, so it must be downloaded from the Apple App Store in advance. Unfortunately, Apple's iPhone app development tools do not run on Windows computers, and most of this class will consist of exercises done on your personal Mac. Please contact the instructor if you have any questions about installing Xcode.

If you have your own iPhone or iPad, please bring it (along with the cable), so that you can run apps on your own device!
