    <h2>What we'll learn today:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Command Line</li>
        <li>Git</li>
        <li>Build tools (Gulp, Grunt, Yeoman etc</li>
        <li>HTML templating</li>
        <li>CSS pre-processors</li>
        <li>Javascript code organization</li>
        <li>Javascript testing</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="notes">These are the topics we'll cover. We will not geo especially deep, but enough to get you
        started and be productive.
        It will also get you far enough to start exploring and learning on your own. You will be js rockstar in no time!

        So, 1. some basic cmdline commands
        2. Git, with special focus on Github and how to be social(forking, pull requests etc..
        3. We'll discuss why use build tools, but for the purposes on exersizes wil use Gulp, and learn about gulp
        tasks already
        available out there.
        4. HTML templating- handlebars in particular. Again this is the one we will use to build out website,
        but you will gain understanding to
        start exploring others
        5. Pre-processors. We will use Less
        6. How to organize your project to make it easier to maintain, understand and collaborate with others
        7. Tesing is the new 'teenage sex'- everyone wants it and everyone says they are doing it,
        but in reality very few are actually
        know how to meaningfully test front end code and it is EXTREMELY marketable skill. When employers see
        test folders on github with good
        tests, that really sets you apart from others. But also it is a really nice tool to gain confidence in
        your code. You will not want to work
        any other way.

    <h2>You should be familiar with:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Git</strong></li>
        <li><strong>HTML and CSS</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Javascript</strong></li>

    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">you do not need to be an expert, but you should be familiar with most concepts. We will g
        enerally, go over most topics. GDI has some classes you can take that offer excellent introduction to these and
        I encourage you to take them, even after this class.
