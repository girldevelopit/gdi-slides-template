## Intro

#### This is a template repo for GDI track repos.

To prevent _**'repo sprawl'**_ (creating repos for individual courses), GDI has track- or subject-matter-specific repos that contain individual courses:

- [HTML & CSS](https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-html-css)
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-javascript)
- [Python](https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-python)
- [User Experience](https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-ux)
- [Data Science](https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-data-science)

#### :exclamation: Use this template repo to create a new track or subject-matter repository, NOT a new course.

- To start a new course, go to your specific track repo and use the `_course-template` folder in that repo.

## Content

This template repo contains a `_course-template` folder and a `shared-assets` folder

The `_course-template` folder is the template for creating ==**individual courses**== that go into the main track or subject-matter repository.

- The course template folder includes a [README](/_course-template/README.md) with instructions for creating courses

The `shared-assets` folder holds custom GDI `css`, `images`, `js` files that ALL course folders reference.

- :exclamation: Do not add course-specific assets or content to the shared-assets folder.

## Usage

To create a new track or subject-matter repo:

- Start and name a new repo in [GDI's main or organizational github account](https://github.com/orgs/girldevelopit/repositories)
  <br>

- Duplicate the contents of this template repo and add them to the new repo
  <br>

- Delete the contents of this README, and update with a description about the new repo
  <br>

- Use the `_course-template` folder to create or start new courses

  - A track repo can contain more than one course
    <br>

- Make sure to also include the `shared-assets` folder in the new repo
